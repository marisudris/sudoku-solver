A little project, inspired by the _Systematic Program Design_ course by [Gregor Kiczales](https://www.edx.org/bio/gregor-kiczales) I took on [EdX](https://www.edx.org/) quite some time ago, exploring recursion (incl. generating recursion), backtracking search and, and front-end design with JavaScript and CSS.

TODO:

- [ ] Fix responsiveness for small devices
- [ ] Add validation if input board is already full
